OK SO!
I'll improve this when time allows, but for now, here's how you get this bitch working:
1. Get Code::Blocks
	- Easy as 
		sudo apt-get install codeblocks
2. go to the lib/ directory and configure and make the files
	- in the freeglut directory,
		- configure, then make
			./configure
			make all
			make install all
	- in the glew directory,
		- EVEN EASIER! JUST MAKE AND INSTALL!
			make all
			make install all
3. Now open the project file (PV.cbp) in Code::Blocks and you've got it!
	- if there are any problems with getting it all set up let me know and I'll take a look. 
	- I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin so if y'alls is using another distro, PRAY that it works...
